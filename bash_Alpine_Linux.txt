# How to run a bash script on Alpine Linux

1. Ensure Bash is Installed:

Alpine Linux uses ash as its default shell, not bash.
Install bash using the package manager: 
```
apk add bash
```

2. Make the Script Executable:

Use chmod +x to make the script executable: 
```
chmod +x your_script.sh
```

3. Run the Script:

Execute the script using bash followed by the script's path: 
```
bash ./your_script.sh
```

Alternatively, if the script has a shebang (#!/bin/bash) line:
```
./your_script.sh
```
